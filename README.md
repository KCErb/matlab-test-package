# matlab-test-package

This little project was written to test out node and npm for MATLAB package management. It went well so npm is what I use now and this package has no future. 

Unfortunately this little test package is around forever, so in case someone stumbles into it I want to warn that there is nothing to see here. Perhaps you were looking for the matpack (all lower case) package which gives an executable for making NPM-MATLAB packages.
